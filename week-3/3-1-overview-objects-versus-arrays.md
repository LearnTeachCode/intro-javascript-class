# 3.1: Overview of objects versus arrays

Whereas the "primitive" data types like numbers, Booleans, and strings contain a *single* chunk of information, objects and arrays contain *multiple* pieces of data. So you can think of objects and arrays as ***containers for related variables***, to help keep everything organized!

Let's take a high-level look at the difference between objects and arrays.

<hr/>

## So what's the difference between an object and an array?

  1. The main difference: arrays contain an ***ordered*** *list of things*, whereas objects have no inherent order. (Like the difference between a filing cabinet and a big bag full of stuff jumbled together.)

  2. Things inside an array can only be accessed by an ***index number***, but things inside an object can be accessed by a ***label***, which you can think of as a string.

  3. Arrays and objects have different built-in functions and properties, which you'll learn more about gradually.

  4. Technically speaking, in JavaScript, arrays are a special type of object! (More on that later!)

## Group discussion: array or object?

For each real-world example below, discuss whether you think it makes more sense to model it in our code as an array, an object, or some *combination of the two*. (Yes, you can put arrays inside objects, objects inside arrays, arrays inside other arrays, etc!)

  1. The chapters in a book
  
  2. The lyrics for a song like "The Twelve Days of Christmas"
  
  3. A particular car with information like its make, model, and a list of its parts
  
  4. All the letters in the alphabet
  
  5. The coordinates for an item on a game board grid (like Battleship)
  
  6. A character in a role-playing video game like Dungeons and Dragons or World of Warcraft
  
  7. A userâ€™s profile info (on a site like Facebook)
  
  8. A database containing many many users on a site like Facebook
  
  9. A deck of cards
  
  10. Ikea furniture instructions (just kidding, nobody reads them!)

:trophy: **Onwards!** Next up, we'll write some code to create, access, and modify our own objects.
