# Section 4.1: Review challenges

:weight_lifting_man: Time for a warmup! See how quickly you can do the following practice challenges.

Try to solve these ***without*** looking at any references or examples first, to see which topics are still fresh in your memory and which you should focus on in your next study sessions.

### Challenge 1:

Define a new function named `doNothing` that takes no inputs and doesn't do anything at all. (So just write the shell of a function. Do you remember the syntax off the top of your head?)

Then call your function. (It won't do anything, of course. But write the code to call it anyway!)

<br/>


### Challenge 1:

Create a new variable that contains an array of three numbers. (Name it whatever you want.)

<br/>

### Challenge 2:

Create an object named `dog` that has two properties, `name` and `breed`, which each have strings as values.

<br/>

### Challenge 3:

Display the dog's name in the console.

<br/>

### Challenge 4:

Create another object named `dog2`, with a different name and breed.

<br/>

### Challenge 5:

Create an array named `dogsArray` that contains those two dog objects as elements.

<br/>

### Challenge 6:

Access the second dog in the array and display it (the whole object) in the console.

### Challenge 7:

Access the breed of the second dog, and display it (*only its breed*) in the console.
