# Section 4.1: Review challenges

:weight_lifting_man: Time for a warmup! See how quickly you can do the following practice challenges.

Try to solve these ***without*** looking at any references or examples first, to see which topics are still fresh in your memory and which you should focus on in your next study sessions.

<br/>

:star: **For these challenges, remix this Glitch project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/js-warmup4.*

<br/>

<hr/>

### Challenge 1:

Define a new function named `doNothing` that takes no inputs and doesn't do anything at all. (So just write the shell of a function. Do you remember the syntax off the top of your head?)

Then call your function. (It won't do anything, of course. But write the code to call it anyway!)

<br/>

### Challenge 2:

Next, define another new function named `logSum` that will accept ***two* parameters**. It should add those inputs together and display the answer in the browser's console.

Then call the function ***three*** times, giving it different **arguments** each time.

<br/>

### Challenge 3:

Set up an event listener so that when the user clicks on the button, the text of the paragraph at the bottom of the page will change to display `"I feel brand new!"`

<br/>

### Challenge 4:

There's something wrong with the code below. What's wrong? Fix it and save your solution in your Glitch project along with all your other answers.

```javascript
let topScore = 99;
let userScore = 50;

if ( userScore > topScore)
  consle.log = "You set a new record!";
} else if (userScore => 30) {
  Console.log("You did OK. You got ' + userScore " points.);
else {
  consol.log("Wow, you're really bad at this game.");
}
```

<br/>

### Challenge 5:

First, define two variables: `isMonday` and `numberOfCookies`. Assign a Boolean value to `isHappy` and a number to `numberOfCookies`.

Next, write the code to display the following messages in the browser console based on this logic:

  - Display `"This will be a great week!"` if `isMonday` is true and `numberOfCookies` is 3 or higher.
  
  - Display `"This week will be horrible!"` if `isMonday` is true and `numberOfCookies` is 0.
  
  - Display `"I can't wait til Friday!"` if `isMonday` is false.
  
<br/>

### Challenge 6:

What will the following code will display in the console? Make a prediction first, and **write down *why*** you think it'll work that way.

```javascript
console.log( 1 !== 4 || 3 > 5 );
```
