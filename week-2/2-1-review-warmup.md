# Section 2.1: Review challenges

:weight_lifting_man: To warm up your coding muscles for today's class (which should be a good workout!), **see how quickly** you can do the following practice challenges.

Try to solve these ***without*** looking at any references or examples first, to see which topics are still fresh in your memory and which you should focus on in your next study sessions.

<br/>

**Note:** For the questions/code that would require interaction with a web page, you don't need to actually test it. This is just a thought exercise to help you review what you remember and what you might need to practice more. We'll review the answers together afterwards.

<hr/>

### Challenge 1:

Create a new variable that contains a number as its value, and display it in the console.

<br/>

### Challenge 2:

Display three strings in the console, ***without*** saving any of them to the computer's memory.

<br/>

### Challenge 3:

Create two new variables, one with your name and one with your favorite color. Then concatenate those variables with other strings as needed to make the console display `"Hello, I'm NAMEHERE and my favorite color is COLORHERE."`

<br/>

### Challenge 4:

Using the code you wrote for challenge #3, change it just a little bit so that instead of showing the result in the console, your code would instead show the result on the web page -- it should replace the *entire* web page with your text!

<br/>

### Challenge 5:

How would you change the text of a paragraph with the unique ID of `"important"` so that it will display `"This is very important!"` on the page (only in that paragraph, leaving the rest of the web page intact)?

<br/>

### Challenge 6:

Take a look at the drawing of the computer's memory below, and then ***write the code*** that, once executed, would make the state of the memory look like this:

| name    | value |
|------|-------|
| `numberOfPenguins` | `undefined` |
| `numberOfKoalas` | `73` |


<br/>

### Challenge 7:

What do you think is the goal of the code below, and will it work? Why or why not?

If not, how would you fix it so that it accomplishes the goal?

```javascript
let num = 7;
num + "3" = 10;
```

<br/>

### Challenge 8:

What's wrong with the code below, and why? How would you fix it?

```javascript
let fruitJoke = "Time flies like an arrow...";

let fruitJoke = "Fruit flies like a banana";
```

<br/>

### Challenge 9:

What will the following code display in the console? Make a prediction first, write down *why*, and then test it:

```javascript
console.log(5 - "3");
```


<br/>

### Challenge 10:

Would this code work? Why or why not?

```javascript
document.getElementById(theanswer).textContent = 42;
```
