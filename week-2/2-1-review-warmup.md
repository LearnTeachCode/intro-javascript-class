# 2.1: Review warmup challenges

:weight_lifting_man: To warm up your coding muscles for today's class (which should be a good workout!), **see how quickly** you can do the following practice challenges.

Try to solve these ***without*** looking at any references or examples first, to see which topics are still fresh in your memory and which you should focus on in your next study sessions.

<hr/>

### Challenge 1:

Create a new variable that contains a number as its value, and display it in the console.

<br/>

### Challenge 2:

Create an object named `dog` that has two properties, `name` and `breed`, which each have strings as values.

<br/>

### Challenge 3:

Display the dog's name in the console.

<br/>

### Challenge 4:

How would you call (in other words, *execute*, *run*, or *invoke*) an imaginary function named `createUnicorn` with ***one string*** as its input?

<br/>

### Challenge 5:

How would you call an imaginary function named `computeAverage` with ***three numbers*** as inputs?

<br/>

### Challenge 6:

Create a new variable that contains a Boolean value.

<br/>

### Challenge 7:

On a new line of code (without modifying your code for the previous challenge), ***change*** the value of that Boolean variable to become its opposite value.

<br/>

### Challenge 8:

Define a new function named `doNothing` that doesn't do anything and doesn't take any inputs -- just the empty shell of a function.

<br/>

### Challenge 9:

Create a new JavaScript object that represents (and will let us access or modify) this HTML element: `<h1 id="title">My Awesome Website</h1>`.

<br/>

### Challenge 10:

Create an event listener on the object you just created for the previous challenge, which waits for an event named `"dblclick"` and calls your function from the previous challenge named `doNothing`.

:weight_lifting_woman: **Are your coding muscles ready for a workout now?** Keep practicing every day -- not just reading about code, but writing your own! :)

:point_right: **Next up:** [in section 2.2, we'll take a quick look at one (limited) form of persistent data using a new version of our click-counter game](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/may-2018-int/week-2/2-2-persistent-data.md).
