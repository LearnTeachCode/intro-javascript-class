# 2.4: Debugging our Hangman game

:trophy: **The challenge:** Following the provided set of prompts, try to figure out what's wrong with our game and how to fix it, documenting each step as you go.

It's OK if you don't actually solve it; the point here is just to come up with some ideas, practice debugging with a strategic and scientific approach, and share your process with the rest of our class.

<br/>:beetle: **The bug:** Our super minimal Hangman game ([see the app here](https://hangman-v0-broken.glitch.me/)) is basically finished, but there's one problem: **if the user enters the correct answer, the game still says "you lose!"** What went wrong?

<br/>:clock2: **Time to complete:** Try not to spend more than 15 minutes on ***each iteration*** your debugging process. (But try to do the whole process more than once to test a couple different hypotheses.)

  > **Note:** If you've *already* solved this bug, then please use the prompts to document *different* ways to discover, confirm, or fix the bug!

## Instructions:

Taking inspiration from [the scientific method as outlined in section 1.6.1 (debugging overview)](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-6-debugging.md#161-background-reading-on-bugs-debugging-and-bug-reports), go through the following steps and write up a report on your debugging experiments, answering all the prompts below for *each* of your hypotheses.

  > **Note:** We've already finished step 1 and 2 of [the scientific method](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-6-debugging.md#161-background-reading-on-bugs-debugging-and-bug-reports) as a group: we've *observed* the specific bug (you can't win the game!), and our questions are: *why* is this bug happening, and *how* can we fix it? So now you'll complete the next steps.

<br/>

**To write and share your debugging report:**

  1. Make a fork of the GitHub repo for this debugging template by clicking the **Fork** button on the top right of the page: https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/debugging-report-template
  
  2. Follow [GitHub's instructions to edit the `README` file](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change) in that repo and fill out your answers following each prompt there.
  
  3. Follow [GitHub's instructions to share your debugging report by making a ***pull request***](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).

:trophy: ***Wonderful!*** If you continue practicing strategic debugging this way, pretty soon you'll be better at debugging than many professional programmers! **Next up:** Repeat the process again (or a few times!) to test your other hypotheses for the bug in our Hangman game.
