# 1.1: Getting started with our first software tools

Writing quality code is a form of *craftsmanship*, just like blacksmithing or carpentry; in software development, using the right tools for the job can make all the difference. (Fun fact: [software craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) is totally a thing! So is [software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)!) Let's get a jump start before our first class by getting familiar with a few of the first tools we'll be using.

‚úîÔ∏è **To complete this section:** Follow the steps below to get started with Slack, GitHub, Glitch, and Visual Studio Code. Please complete this *before our first class meeting*! 

‚ùì **If you have any questions,** please ask on the private Slack channel for our class. (See below for an intro to Slack.)

## 1.1.4: Intro to Chrome's developer tools and the browser console

Meet your new best friend: the dev tools built right into your web browser! This is a quick intro to opening the console, inspecting HTML with the Elements panel, and applying JavaScript code directly to the current web page.

:tv: **Video: Intro to Chrome's developer tools and the browser console (4 min): https://youtu.be/O_sJE_3jKZ4**

**Tasks to do:**

  - [ ] Make sure you have the latest version of Google Chrome; that's the browser we will be using in class! (Let us know if you have trouble getting it to work on your computer though.)
  
  - [ ] Write down the keyboard shortcut for opening your browser console: **Ctrl + Shift + J** on Windows, or **Cmd + Opt + J** on Mac.
  
  - [ ] Practice using the Inpsect tool to see the HTML and CSS of your favorite websites, and try changing something to see the page update instantly!
  
  - [ ] Practice changing the text, background color, or other properties of your favorite websites by typing JavaScript code into the browser console. For example: `document.body.textContent = "Some new text here! Cool!";`
  
  - [ ] Test out using the built-in `console.log()` function in your JavaScript file and then checking if your messages appear in the browser console when you refresh your web page.

**Chrome browser resources:**

## 1.1.5: Intro to text editors: Visual Studio Code

Take the first step in setting up your local development environment by installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is currently the most popular text editor in the JavaScript community.

:tv: **Video: Intro to Visual Studio Code (8 min): https://youtu.be/av257EQfefU**

**Tasks to do:**

  - [ ] [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (runs on MacOS version 10.9 or higher, or Windows 7, 8, or 10). Or if you have any problems getting VS Code to work, try [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/), another very popular text editor!

  - [ ] Go to the File menu and click "Auto Save" to automatically save your files. (Highly recommended!)
  
  - [ ] Make the text bigger or smaller by holding down `Ctrl` on Windows or `Cmd` on Mac, and then pressing the `+` (plus) or `-` (minus) keys. You can also do this from the menu: View > Zoom In or Zoom Out.
  
  - [ ] Try out the different color schemes! Go to File > Preferences > Color Theme to explore the built-in themes.

**Visual Studio Code resources:**

  - [Visual Studio Code's official "Getting Started" guides](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
  
  - [Official VS Code intro videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos)

## 1.1.6: Creating websites locally with VS Code

A quick overview of how to create a web page locally on your computer and then view it in your web browser.

:tv: **Video: Creating websites locally with VS Code (5 min): https://youtu.be/E4FmXNatxt0**

**Tasks to do:**

  - [ ] Practice creating a website on your computer in Visual Studio Code, or whichever text editor you prefer -- the steps are basically the same!
  
  - [ ] Try making a typo in one of your file names or in the `<script>` or `<link>` tags in your HTML file, and see what happens when you load your web page. (Then don't forget to fix it again!)
