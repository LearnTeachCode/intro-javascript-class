# 1.3: Homework Part 1: Review challenges

Like they say, practice makes perfect! Here are some practice challenges to help you review [the basics from our first class](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/tree/may-2018-int/week-1). 

‚ùì **If you have any questions, please ask on the private Slack channel for our class.** (See our [**intro to Slack video**](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#111-intro-to-slack) if you need a refresher.)

## Setup

  1. **Remix the official Glitch web page starter template: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/hello-webpage**

  > See our [intro to Glitch video](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#113-intro-to-glitch) if you need a refresher!

  2. **Share your progress and post the link to your Glitch project on our private Slack channel**!

<br/>

## Challenge 1:

Modify the HTML and the JavaScript files in your new Glitch project so that the user can click on a button, and when they do, a message like `"Hello there!"` will appear inside a paragraph on the web page.

  > Try to do this *before* looking at previous examples -- see how much you remember off the top of your head! Spend at least 15 minutes on it, and then use the review materials below if you need them to finish this challenge.
  
**Review materials from our beginner curriculum:**

  - [DOM practice challenges](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-2-dom-challenges.md)
  - :tv: [Videos on flowcharting, variables, and the DOM](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-5-review-hangman-game.md)
  - [Event listener challenges](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-2/2-2-event-listener-challenges.md)
  - :tv: [Video on events and event listeners](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-2/2-5-review-videos-hangman-part2.md#251-intro-to-events-and-event-listeners)

<br/>

## Challenge 2:

Somewhere at the top of your JavaScript file, create a new variable that contains a JavaScript object with data representing at least three things about yourself -- for example: your name, zip code, and hometown.

Then change your code from challenge 1 so that when the user clicks the button, one piece of data from your object will be displayed on the page!

**Review materials from our beginner curriculum:**

  - :tv: [Video review of objects and practice challenges](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-3/3-2-object-challenges.md)
  - [Overview of objects vs arrays](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-3/3-1-overview-objects-versus-arrays.md)

<br/>

## Challenge 3:

Somewhere on your web page, write a list of the steps required to complete challenge #1 above -- like a recipe for other beginner programmers to follow!

  > Feel free to use paragraphs, an ordered or unordered list, a table, or whatever HTML elements you want for structuring your web page.

<br/>

## Challenge 4:

Now, break it! Create **five bugs** in your JavaScript code -- get creative, and try breaking things in different ways! Share your bugs with us by posting a link to your Glitch project in our private Slack channel, so we can practice debugging each others' code!

:trophy: **Great work!** As you know, taking time to review and practice is the *most important* part of learning a new skill. Practice a little bit every day and you'll master these skills before you know it!
