# Planning our group project: Dragon Defeater!

Let's build a super tiny game to start learning the basics of combining JavaScript with HTML to create an interactive web page! We'll start by planning out the game and identifying what we'll need to learn in order to create it.

This will also serve as a model for the planning process that you'll use for your own projects.

 <hr/>

## What are we building?

:hammer: Let's create one of the simplest video games ever invented: **a click-counter game!** Yes, there's an entire genre of games where the sole purpose is to click a button as many times as you can. (Usually there's a time limit, but we'll leave that out for now.)

**Feature requirements:**

  - There should be a button that the user can click on.
  
  - And there should be a paragraph that says how many times the button was clicked.
  
  - Every time the user clicks that button, the number of clicks should increase by one, and that new number should be displayed in the paragraph described above.
  
  - Initially, that paragraph should say that the button was clicked **0** times.
  
  - ... and that's all! Super simple!

<br/>

As with any project, no matter how big or small, we'll begin by making a plan. This means *no coding* and *no computers* needed at all for these first steps!

<br/>

## Challenge 1:

:hourglass_flowing_sand: Get out your pencils and paper! In ***two minutes or less***, draw a quick sketch of the user interface for this application.

Keep it simple. (It is a ridiculously tiny game, after all!)

<br/>

## Challenge 2:

**Let's discuss the following:**

<br/>

  1. What information does the computer need to remember for this game to work? Another way to think about this: what information *changes* over time, between when the user starts using our app until they stop using our app?
  
  > **Side note:** We call this [the ***state*** of the program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)). The *state* refers to the information stored by the computer to remember past actions. The *state* combined with any *inputs* determine what the computer program will do next.

<br/>

  2. How many **HTML elements** (parts of the web page like a button or paragraph) will our JavaScript code need to interact with? What do we need to *access* or *change* for each of these elements?

<br/>

  3. What **external events** (outside the control of your code) will affect the state of this system?

<br/>

## Challenge 3:

:hourglass_flowing_sand: In ***two minutes or less***, sketch out a quick **flowchart** of the steps required for this game to work. Be as detailed as possible; imagine you're the computer outlining the steps that need to happen in your code!

<br/>

## Challenge 4:

Let's brainstorm some questions! Asking specific questions is a *skill* in and of itself, and practicing this skill will make you a more effective learner. So, let's practice!

<br/>

**Discuss** and be sure to **write down** your questions:

  1. What will you need to learn how to do in order to build this game?
  
  2. Which things do you *already* know how to do?
  
  3. When you sketched out your ideas for the user interface and made your initial flowchart, what questions did that bring up for you? (About programming or the planning process in general?)

<br/>

## Create your own personal copy of our HTML mockup using Glitch:

Imagine you're a new JavaScript developer and it's your first day on the job. The designer on your team created a web page for our game, which serves as what we call an ***HTML mockup*** -- an actual web page with all the HTML code completed, but without any functionality.

Your job is to make it functional, taking this static page and making it come to life! In other words, let's give it some *brains!* 

<br/>

**Instructions:**

  1. [**Click here to open our HTML mockup on Glitch**](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dragon-defeater-v0-starter).
  
  2. To save your own personal copy of the template project, click the project's name in the top left corner, and then click **"Remix This"** in the dropdown menu.
  
  2. It will reload the page, and you'll see that Glitch generates a new name for your project name made of *two random words*. This is your own personal copy of the project that nobody else can edit.
  
  3. To see the live app and test it out, click **"Show Live"** on the top left and it'll open the web page in another tab.

:trophy: **Great work so far!** Most of the hard work in building something new will happen *away* from the computer -- sketching, flowcharting, and discussing with others out loud.

:point_right: **Next up:** [in section ####, .....](#)!
