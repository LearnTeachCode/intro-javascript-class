# 1.4: Practice challenges: Conditional statements and comparison operators

Conditional statements are how we can tell computers to make a decision based on some given information. Any time we have questions or decision points in the flow chart representing our app, we'll need to use conditional statements in our code. Let's learn with some more practice challenges!

**Again, you can run your code in several different ways:**

  1. Use [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) to visualize your code step-by-step (no access to HTML or CSS though, only simple JavaScript that can run on its own)
  
  2. Run your code directly inside your web browser's JavaScript console (see [section 1.1.4 for a review](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#114-intro-to-chromes-developer-tools-and-the-browser-console))
  
  3. Use a [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) project to test your code with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files all within your web browser (see [section 1.1.3 for a review](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#113-intro-to-glitch))
  
  4. Create everything locally on your computer with Visual Studio Code or any text editor that you prefer (see [section 1.1.5 and 1.1.6 for a review of VS Code](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md#115-intro-to-text-editors-visual-studio-code))
