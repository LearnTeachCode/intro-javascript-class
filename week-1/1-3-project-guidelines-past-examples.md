# 1.3: Project guidelines and examples of past student projects

Any project, however big or small, can be made to fit within our class! Here are a few general guidelines and past student projects to help you get a sense of the wide range of possibilities.

<br/>

:star: **Please complete [section 1.2](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/july-aug-2018/week-1/1-2-project-planning.md) *before* you look at the projects below.** That way these examples won't affect or limit your own project brainstorming. :)

## General project guidelines

Now that you've finished brainstorming and planning a couple of your first ideas, here's our philosophy to keep in mind as you start to choose and move forward with one of your project ideas:

  1. The goal is to ***start*** a project and ***learn*** from it. Finishing the project doesn't matter.
 
 <br/>
 
  2. Like they say in the world of tech startups: **"fail fast, fail often"**. We learn more from our mistakes than from our successes, so we'll aim to *fail forward* and trust that with persistence, we'll eventually get things right.

 <br/>

  > **"I have not failed 999 times. I have simply found 999 ways how *not* to create a light bulb."**<br/><br/>-- Thomas Edison<br/>*(Nobody seems to know if he actually said this, but hey, it's still a good quote!)*

<br/>

  3. Pick a project that you think will keep you motivated! It doesn't matter if it's a huge project or a tiny project; it doesn't matter if it's practical or useful in any way. As long as it sounds fun and exciting to you, then it's a good idea!

<br/>

  4. Focus on ***functionality*** first. We want to make lots of *ugly*, *unfinished* web apps. Don't worry about making it look nice until *after* you have a working prototype.
 
 <br/>
 
  5. Always assume everything will take longer than you think -- *at least twice as long*, if not more! This is a classic problem of software development that all programmers struggle with. We almost never know just how many details we'll need to figure out in order to complete a project, and we never know how many bugs we'll need to fix.
 
 <br/>
 
  6. Turning your vision into reality is *hard* -- for professional engineers too, not just for beginners! Our brains are great at seeing the big picture, but terrible at seeing all the tiny details required to make it work. Throughout our class, we'll work together on how to break apart your idea into tiny pieces that can be turned into code.

<br/>

## Examples of past student projects

Almost no projects get finished within the span of our class, but our past students had a lot of fun working on their ideas and learned a lot from all the bugs they encoutered! That's the goal. :)

<br/>

  > **Note:** If you have more experience with programming and/or more time to spend on your project outside of class, then you can definitely make something more ambitious than the examples below. If you have less time, most of these projects are a good example of what you can finish while you're learning how to code.

<br/>

1. **Minimalistic Minesweeper** (work in progress)
   - Demo: https://minesweeper-container.glitch.me/
   - This is a great example of taking a big idea and breaking it up into smaller steps: a one-row Minesweeper for now, before making the full grid!
   - **Time:** This was completed in 4 weeks, with minimal study time outside of class.

<br/>

2. **Star Trek themed placeholder text generator**
   - Demo: https://tinuola.github.io/ferengi-ipsum/
   - See the code and project planning notes: https://github.com/tinuola/ferengi-ipsum
   - This project was created by our TA who has a lot of experience with creating websites.

<br/>

3. **Smile Path list** (work in progress)
   - Demo: https://smile-path.glitch.me/smilepath.html
   - This is a to-do list, but for tracking your big life goals / bucket list! 
   - **Time:** This was completed in 8 weeks, with minimal study time outside of class.

<br/>

4. **Flipbook of inspiration** (work in progress)
   - Demo: https://sketchapp-idea.glitch.me/
   - This is a first prototype of an app that would let users submit prompts for drawing sketches and view a random prompt from the list. (Click the word "random" at the bottom to change the prompt.)


<br/>

5. **The Koko Hotel** (work in progress)
   - Demo: https://koko-hotel.glitch.me/
   - This student was more interested in design than functionality, so their mockup already has some styling. Later this will be a registration website for an imaginary hotel -- a fun and silly idea, because hey, why not? :)
   - **Time:** This was completed within 4 weeks.
   
<br/>

6. **Battleship game** (work-in-progress)
   - Demo: https://battleshipremix2.glitch.me/
   - Another great example of breaking up an ambitious idea into smaller steps. For now, user's enter a row and column to fire at a ship; later on, this student plans to let users click directly on the grid and see visual feedback.
   - **Time:** This was completed within 8 weeks, with minimal study time outside of class.

<br/>

7. **To-do list** (work in progress) (experimental, also a work-in-progress)
   - Demo: https://new-to-do-list.glitch.me/
   - This project saves the user's data so they can retrieve it later. Lots of experimental features thrown in, which is all part of the creative process -- try everything out, then see what works and what doesn't!
   - **Time:** The bulk of this project was completed in 4 weeks.

<br/>

8. **Minimal Tetris game** (unfinished)
   - Demo: https://tetris-may2018.glitch.me/
   - This is another example of bite-sized steps towards building an ambition project! So far, this student has finished the very first building blocks of Tetris: drawing squares on the screen and making them fall from the top to the bottom, with one on top of the other.
   - **Time:** This was completed in 8 weeks, with minimal study time outside of class.
