# Section ###: Intro to data types

So far, we've learned how to display data on the web page and in the browser's console.

Let's take a closer look at the *types* of data that we can work with, and then figure out how to use our data in more complex ways!

## Review and group discussion:

Let's take a closer look at what we've learned so far, and discuss:

  1. What ***type*** of information have we been using so far? Looking at the data from our previous examples, what did they all have in common?
  
  2. What are some other types of data?
  
  3. How would you define the concept of a ***data type*** in one sentence, in plain-and-simple English with ***no*** technical terms?

:trophy: ***Great work!*** Data types are at the very heart of computing, both in theory and in practice. You'll be making use of different types of data *every single day* when you're coding!
