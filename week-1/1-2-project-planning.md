# 1.2: Project brainstorming and initial planning

Time to write down some of your ideas and get them out of your head and onto paper! This is one of the most important steps in building anything new -- even more important than writing the code itself. (You need to know *what* you're building before you can build it, after all!)

<br/>

:star: It's best to use your favorite writing tool (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, etc) to save your progress, especially if you don't do it all in one sitting. Then when you're done, follow the instructions below to submit your work.

<br/>

‚ùì **If you have any questions,** please ask on the private Slack channel for our class. (See below for an intro to Slack.)

## 1. Quick project brainstorming (Creativity warmup!)

:hourglass: For this step, **set a timer for 10 minutes**. You can time yourself with an app on your phone, an old-school kitchen timer, or a silly YouTube video meme that loops for 10 minutes:

  - [10 min of Nyan Cat on piano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbzUen207iw)
  - [10 min of the bacon pancakes song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnHUGp_e7Q8)
  - or [10 min of the Trololo guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwwWtOhk8yA)

<br/>

:pencil: In those 10 minutes, write a list of ***as many app ideas*** as you can think of! Can you write down ***20 ideas*** in ten minutes? How about 50? :)

<br/>

**Guidelines:**

  - Don't take your pen off the paper / don't take your hands off the keyboard! No editing, no revising!
  
  - The app ideas you write down ***don't*** have to be things that you want to make.
  
  - They ***don't*** have to be new ideas either.

<br/>

The point is to just write down as many as you can think of, to warm up the creative side of your brain!

<br/>

## 2. Your top 3 project ideas

Next, **identify** any of the ideas from your list that you might enjoy trying to create! It's OK if the app already exists; you can create your own version with a unique twist.

<br/>

Then write down a new list of your ***top 3 app ideas*** that you might like to create.

  > Don't spend more than a few minutes on this; you can always change your mind later.

<br/>

## 3. Key features of each app idea

For ***each*** of your top 3 app ideas, write a short list of key features to describe how each app would work.

<br/>

**Prompts to spark some ideas:**

  - Does this app help solve a problem? If so, how?
  - What are the steps that the user must take in order to use this app?
  - Can the user save information? View information? If so, how?
  - What does the user *see* when they're using this app?
  - How does the app *change* over time, from when the user starts using it, until they stop?

<br/>

## 4. User interface elements for each app

For ***each*** of your top 3 ideas, make a quick list of the elements that would appear on the page.

<br/>

**Examples:**

  - A text box for the user to type in their favorite food
  - A "save" button for the user to save their info
  - A list of items on the user's to-do list
  - A grid for the game board
  - A box showing the user's current score

<br/>

## 5. Quick sketches of each app

Last step! For ***each*** of your top 3 ideas, spend a few minutes drawing a several quick sketches for what each app's user interface could look like.

<br/>

:tv: **[Watch this video on wireframing for examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmmQjLqJQlY)** (5 min)

<br/>

:pencil: Aim to draw ***at least three*** sketches for ***each idea***. Pen and paper is best for these very first sketches!

:hourglass: You should be able to draw each sketch in ***one minute or less***, so aim to draw ***at least 9 sketches total*** in just ***9 minutes***!

<br/>

:white_checkmark: When you're done, take a picture of them with your phone and upload them to your computer (or just email them to yourself). Have them handy when you follow the steps below to submit your work!

<br/>

## Submit your work

:white_check_mark: Congrats, you're done! **Follow the steps below to submit your work** and share your ideas with us:

<br/>

  1. Before anything else, you'll need to be logged into your [GitHub](https://github.com/login) account.
  
  > If you haven't already, please complete [section 1.1](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/july-aug-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md) first!

<br/>

  2. Go to [**this GitHub discussion page**](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/issues/28) where we'll all share our ideas.
  
  <br/>

:trophy: ***Great work!***  See how quickly you can generate *lots* of ideas? Once you choose the project you'd like to work on, you'll refine these ideas over the course of our 8 weeks together.

:point_right: **Next up: go to [section 1.3 to take a look at some examples of past student projects, plus guidelines for building your own](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/july-aug-2018/week-1/1-3-project-guidelines-past-examples.md)**.
