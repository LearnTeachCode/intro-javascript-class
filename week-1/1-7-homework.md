## 1. Create a GitHub repository for your project

On GitHub, projects are called "repositories" or "repos" for short. GitHub is a great place to share your code, get feedback on it, and invite others to collaborate on your projects!

  - [ ] Read and follow the instructions in [this help page from GitHub on how to create a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/).

  - [ ] Give your repo a short but descriptive name that describes your project. **Note:** The most common naming convention for repos is to keep it all lowercase, with words separated by hyphens. For example: `my-awesome-project`.
  
  - [ ] Don't forget to check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README." A README file contains general information about your project. It's a convention dating back to [at least the 1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README)!

<br/>


## 2. Add your project planning notes

Add any notes you wrote down in class to your `README.md` file on GitHub!

  - [ ] Following [GitHub's instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/#commit-your-first-change), add your previous notes to your `README.md` file and save the changes.

  - [ ] You can make the formatting nicer by using Markdown, a popular formatting language that's easier and faster to write than HTML. (It's the standard used by GitHub and StackOverflow!) See [GitHub's Markdown reference page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

<br/>


## 3. Outline your first implementation details

Based on what you've learned so far, you can already start digging into *how* you'll start building the first prototype for your project! **In your `README.md` file, write down some notes based on the following prompts.** It's OK if they're just bullet points.

  1. **How would you describe the inputs of your app?**
  <br/>What goes in? What data does your app take in from the user, if any? Will it get data from a databse or from a third-party service?
  
  2. **How would you describe the outputs or possible outcomes of your app?**
  <br/>Based on those inputs, what does the app display to the user? What are some of the *outcomes* or *results* that your app produces based on how the user interacts with it?
  
  3. **What would you store as variables in your JavaScript file for the first prototype of your app?**
  <br/>What does the computer need to *remember* between when the user starts the app and when they close the page?<br/>
  
  4. **Which kinds of data types are these inputs/variables?**
  <br/>Are they strings of text? Numbers? Boolean values (true or false)?

<br/>


## 4. Sketch a flowchart (or a few!)

Borrowing ideas from the two versions of our flowchart for the Hangman game (see [section 1.5 review materials](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-5-review-hangman-game.md)), take a stab at making a flowchart (or a few!) for at least part of your app.

  1. **Draw your flowchart** with a software tool and export it as an image, or draw it on paper and take a photo of it with your phone (and then send it to your computer or email it to yourself). 

  2. **Upload your new flowchart to GitHub,** following [the instructions on how to upload a file](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) directly to their website. **Note:** The file size limit is 25MB.

**Hangman flowchart with implementation details below, for reference:**

Remember, there's *no right answer* for any of this! The point is just to practice thinking about how to translate your ideas into the more detailed steps required to bring your project to life as a functional piece of software. That skill is even more important than just knowing how to write the code itself, and it takes a lot of practice to develop an intuition for this stuff!

<br/>


## 5. Build the start of an HTML mockup

Feel free to copy HTML and/or CSS from [the Hangman game](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-5-review-hangman-game.md) and modify it as needed to start building a mockup of your project (at least part of it)!

:star: You can make your mockup using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) or build it locally on your computer. But either way, **you should at some point upload your HTML and/or CSS files to GitHub**, following [those same instructions linked to above](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/).

  > **If you need a refresher:** Review [section 1.1 on how to use Glitch and Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/march-2018/week-1/1-1-initial-tools-intro.md).

**Some tips:**

  - The point here is just to *get started* and spark some ideas related to your project. Digging into some code, even just a little HTML, can help you look at your project from a different perspective.

  - Please don't get too detailed with this just yet. Don't worry about making it look nice. For any parts that are tricky to display on the page (like a complicated layout), just put a placeholder there like I did with our Hangman game -- I left out the picture, which is possibly the most important part of that game! But that's OK for a first prototype.
  
  - Remember, there's no such thing as cheating here -- so you can browse the web and borrow from other people's code too! 
  
  - For chunks of text beyond headings and short descriptions, just use some fake data! Try a [lorem ipsum generator](https://loremipsumgenerator.com/) to copy-paste paragraphs of text. That's what professional web and graphic designers do!
  
  - For images, you can generate some placeholder images of any size with these free tools: [PlaceIMG](https://placeimg.com/) or [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/). Or feel free to leave out all the images entirely!

Remember, there's *no right answer* for any of this either! Just get started, give it a try, and see what you come up with. Have fun with it and experiment! :)
