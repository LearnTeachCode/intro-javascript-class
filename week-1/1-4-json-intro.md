# 1.4: Intro to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) challenges

After taking a quick look at one less-than-ideal option for persistent data in [the previous section](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/may-2018-int/week-1/1-3-persistent-data.md), we've come to the conclusion that there's only one convenient way to share data in a web app across multiple computers: *send it over the internet!* This brings us to a topic important for both databases and APIs: JavaScript Object Notation, also known as **JSON**!

<hr/>

## Challenge 1:

So, we know that in order to create a multiplayer click-counting game, one way or another we'll need to send the player's information over the internet. Let's approach this challenge by starting with a silly activity!

First, make sure you've played the game from the previous section and keep it open in a tab for quick reference: https://dragon-defeater-v1-localstorage.glitch.me/

Next -- and yes, this is silly, but bear with me! -- **write me an email to send me the data from your game.** Just type with your fingers, and however you see fit, send me an email containing all the information saved in *your* specific game. There's no one correct answer, as long as you communicate the data in a way I can read and understand!

  > We'll compare everyone's emails and then discuss!

## JSON: One of many data formats

As we saw, there are many different ways to communicate the same information! That brings us to an important point:

:star: There's a difference between ***the data itself***, stored in the computers memory, and the different ***representations*** of that data once it's transformed into a ***human-readable string of characters***.



The browser console is smart, it knows how to convert a js object into a convenient way to look inside it to make our jobs as developers easier. to display the data to us.

The way we see it here, and the way we've been writing our objects so far, is JSON! 

Challenge: display the contents of this JS object on a web page.  (Wont work as expected!)
