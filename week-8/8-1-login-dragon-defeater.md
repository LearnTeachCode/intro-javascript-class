# 8.1: Putting it all together: "Dragon Defeater" for multiple users

In [our class last week](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/tree/may-2018-int/week-7), we built two small group projects: a tiny example of a user login system with Firebase and GitHub, and then a collaborative version of our Dragon Defeater game where we had one shared score for everyone.

Today, let's combine the two together!


:books: **Prerequisites:**
  - [Review our group project from week 7 here](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/tree/may-2018-int/week-7)

## Planning our app

:hammer: **What are we building?** We'll create the third version of Dragon Defeater where multiple users can log in and keep track of their own individual scores.

<br/>

**Feature requirements:**

  - Users can log in with their GitHub account

  - When the user logs in:
    - Show the user interface for the game
    - Display their name, email, and profile photo from their GitHub account
    - Display their current score that was saved in the database
    - Create (or update) their account by saving their info to the database

  - When the user clicks the "Defeat a Dragon!" button:
    - Increase their score by 1
    - Insert their new score into the database

  - When the user logs out:
    - Hide the user interface for the game

Once again, we'll begin by making a plan. Time for sketching! :pencil:

<br/>

## Challenge 1:

Let's split up into two teams for this one! Each team will draw a detailed flowchart for one of the apps we built together last week:

  1. [Last week's version of Dragon Defeater (v2)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dragon-defeater-v2-group-finished)
  2. [Last week's login system example project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/group-firebase-github-login-finished)

These will be detailed flowcharts, illustrating what our code needs to do step by step.

<br/>

## Challenge 2:

Working in teams again, add to your flowchart to include the ***names of variables and functions*** associated with each step. You can even include the line numbers if you want.

  > The goal here is to practice mapping steps (from our human brains) to the actual code (the computer's "brains")!

<br/>

## (Group) Challenge 3:

All together now! Let's draw a new flowchart that outlines what we think we need to do to build our new app, combining pieces from both of our previous apps.

The more detail, the better! Let's reuse those function names wherever possible!

<br/>

## Challenge 4:

:trophy: **Great work, team!** We've applied our new knowledge to create a web app with that contains some of the most common components that exist in the many applications we use every day (like all social network sites, online shopping sites, productivity tools, games, and more). With more practice, you can expand on this example to create working prototypes for any ideas you can think of!

:point_right: **Next up:** [in section 8.2, we'll ....](https://github.com/LearnTeachCode/intro-javascript-class/blob/may-2018-int/week-8/8-2-*************.md)!
