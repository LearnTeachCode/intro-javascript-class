:weight_lifting_woman: Let's warm up those coding muscles with a few quick review challenges!

## Challenge 1:

<br/>

:star: **For all of these review challenges, *remix this Glitch project:* https://glitch.com/edit/#!/firebase-practice-4**

<br/>

Remember objects? This should only take a minute then! :) In your remixed copy of the Glitch project (link above), **create a new object that represents yourself.** Give it two or three different properties.

<br/>

## Challenge 2:
...
Review db structure:

  - make an object representing yourself with 3 properties
  - small example Glitch to remix, identify path (give yourself a unique ID #), make db ref object, and insert object into our Firebase dB
  - set vs update
