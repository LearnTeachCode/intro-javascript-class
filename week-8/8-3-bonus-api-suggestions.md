# 8.3: Bonus homework: Suggestions for APIs to tinker with

We've learned ***so much*** new stuff in our class, and that's still just scratching the surface of what's possible with your new coding superpowers!

In case you want to tinker with some new APIs, here are some extra suggestions for bonus homework to help spark some new ideas for fun, interesting, or just plain silly apps that you now have the tools to start building!

<hr/>

## More API suggestions

APIs here, get yer APIs here! Mix and match them however you like:

  - The [Oxford Dictionaries API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) lets you retrieve definitions, synonyms, and all sorts of useful stuff for any given word!

  - The [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/) lets you search for animated GIFs, get random images, and other fun stuff! 

  - The [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) is a massive database with more than you ever wanted to know about all the different Pokemon, their abilities, evolutionary trees, etc.
  
  - [Microsoft Cognitive Services Face API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview) gives information about an image of a face (like the person's gender, age, mood, etc) or to detect where faces are in any given image.
  
  - [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) provides APIs to let your apps work with text messages and phone calls! Companies like Uber and Lyft use their APIs to send automatic text updates. You'll definitely need to start working with server-side programming to get started with their API, but they are starting to add [example projects on Glitch](https://glitch.com/twilio) to make it a bit easier to get started!

  - [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/) is a craft beer API with tons of details about all the beers you've never heard of!
  
  - The [Nutritionix API](https://developer.nutritionix.com/docs/v2) generates calorie information for natural-language phrases about food and exercise. (See [their liive demo](https://www.nutritionix.com/natural-demo?q=1%20cup%20mashed%20potatoes%20and%202%20tbsp%20gravy&s=1))
  
  - [OpenWeatherMap's APIs](https://openweathermap.org/api) provide weather information for anywhere in the world!
  
  - The [Google Maps collection of APIs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) will provide all sorts of information about locations, directions, distances, estimated travel times, and other cool stuff!

  - The [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) lets you look up information about films and receive it as JSON data (whereas the popular website IMDB only lets you browse that data visually, not as an API... so this is ***OMDB*** because it's Open!)

## A few examples of API project ideas

By combining the APIs above with example code from our class, you can already create a working prototype of just about any idea! Here are a few examples to spark some new project ideas:

<br/>

  1. See a random animated GIF every time you click a button. Even better, let users enter a keyword into a text box to see an animated GIF related to their search term!
  
  <br/>
  
  2. Combine the GIPHY API with another API like the Pokemon API or the Open Movie Database -- for example, let the user enter the name of a pokemon to see information about that Pokemon along with an animated GIF of the Pokemon! (Or the same with movie titles.)
  
  <br/>
  
  3. Make a vocabulary-learning app using the Oxford Dictionary API's "sentence dictionary" feature! Let the user enter a word and see a sentence showing how that word is used. Extra feature: let the user click on other words within each sentence to generate a *new* sentence that illustrates how *that* word is used! 
  
  <br/>
  
  4. Use the Face API from Microsoft Cognitive Services to make a web app that lets users enter the URL to a photo of their face, and then see a list of the information that the Face API's machine learning algorithms can detect about their face. Fun and a little creepy!
  
  <br/>
  
  5. Combine the Face API with the GitHub API for an app that lets you enter anyone's GitHub username, see their profile photo, and *also* see info from the Face API about that person's photo -- whether there's a face in the photo, the gender of the person, etc.

<br/>

  6. Combine the Nutritionix API with Firebase to let users save a list of their meals and estimated calories, so they can look back at their eating habits over time.

<br/>

  7. Combine the Google Maps API with the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather information for a given location, and see it side-by-side with a map of that location.
  
  <br/>
  
  8. Combine the Breweries API with the Google Maps API to let a user see a map showing all the breweries in their neighborhood.
